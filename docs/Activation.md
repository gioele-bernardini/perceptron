Today, the **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** activation function is preferred over the **sigmoid** in many neural network architectures, especially in **deep learning**, for several practical and theoretical reasons. Here are the main reasons:

1. **Vanishing Gradient Problem**

    **Sigmoid:** The **sigmoid** function compresses its inputs to values between 0 and 1. However, for very large or very small input values, the derivative of the sigmoid tends to be very close to zero. This means that during the **backpropagation** process, the **gradient** can become extremely small (almost null), drastically slowing down the update of weights in deep networks. This is known as the **vanishing gradient problem**.

    **ReLU:** On the other hand, **ReLU** has a constant derivative (1) for positive inputs and zero for negative inputs, which avoids the vanishing gradient problem for most nodes in the network. This allows for more effective gradient propagation and faster **convergence**.

2. **Sparsity of Activations**

    **Sigmoid:** The **sigmoid** function activates almost all neurons, which means that every neuron in the network can have a non-zero output. This leads to greater computational density and can make the network less efficient.

    **ReLU:** **ReLU** sets all negative values to zero, meaning that in a given iteration, many neurons may not be activated (have zero output). This introduces **sparsity** in the activations, making the network more efficient and potentially improving the network's generalization ability, as only a fraction of neurons are activated at any given time.

3. **Computational Efficiency**

    **Sigmoid:** The **sigmoid** function involves exponential calculations, which can be computationally expensive, especially when applied to millions or billions of neurons in deep networks.

    **ReLU:** **ReLU**, being a piecewise linear function, is extremely simple and fast to compute: it is just a comparison with zero, which can be done very efficiently.

4. **Faster Convergence**

    **Sigmoid:** Since the **sigmoid** easily saturates for very positive or negative values, weight updates can become very small, slowing down the training convergence.

    **ReLU:** Thanks to the non-saturating nature of **ReLU** (for positive values), neural networks using ReLU often converge much faster during training, especially when used in combination with modern optimization techniques like the **Adam optimizer**.

5. **ReLU Problems and Variants**

    It is important to note that **ReLU** is not without issues. For example, it can suffer from the "**dying ReLU**" problem, where some neurons can get stuck at zero and never recover. To address this, variants such as **Leaky ReLU** or **Parametric ReLU (PReLU)** have been proposed, which allow a small gradient even for negative inputs.

**Conclusion**

In summary, **ReLU** is preferred over the **sigmoid** primarily because it allows for faster and more efficient convergence in modern **deep learning** models. **ReLU** avoids the **vanishing gradient problem**, produces **sparse** activations, and requires fewer computations, making it a very popular choice for activation functions in deep neural networks.
